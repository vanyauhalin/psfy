## Motivation

MacOS has its own design system, and when some company or person builds an apps using non-native tools (e.g. electron), it looks foreign. There are two options to make the app better: complete rewrite using native tools or in vain to try to modify an existing. I would like to follow the first option, but it will take too long. Therefore, your attention is presented to the app, which consists of a set of styles and scripts for simulating the interface familiar to us.
